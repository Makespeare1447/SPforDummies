 
# SPforDummies: Signal Processing for Dummies 

A project to gather simple python notebooks for doing Signal Processing, Machine Learning and Data Analysis.
## Software Language
This package is written in python. The code is mostly in the form of ipython notebook

## Environment Setup
To run python scripts or ipython notebook you need to setup a python environment. 
This can be done in different ways and some IDE as 

- [PyChar] ( https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ ) 
- [Enthought] (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)  
- [Anaconda] (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

can do it for you. 
Each of them offers free community edition. 

If you prefer to do everything by yourself, you can follow the following instructions to create your local virtual environment:
`http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/`

You have to install also ipython and ipython notebook 
- [ipython](https://ipython.org/)

One you have your python environment setup, you need to install some library packages, which will be used in the notebook or scripts

## Library Packages

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [pandas ](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [statsmodels ](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)

## Further Readings
There are many good tutorial on the net for signal processing and many good book on the argument, so this is only a short list.
